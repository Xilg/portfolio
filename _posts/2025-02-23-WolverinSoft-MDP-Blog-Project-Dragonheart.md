# Introduction - TOTAL TIME: 12 hours
Hello!!! Welcome to my second blogpost of the semester for Project Dragonheart!

# GTM: 2 * 2 = 4 hours
This sprint we were focused on finishing up the lowfi UI that was created. A lot of cool little particle effects got into the game which was cool. There was also squish and squash effects added to buildings. God I wish we had done this to the games before hand. I don't know why there was never a focus on these little effects for previous Studio games. We also finished up some nifty shader effects. Eli got started on the Day and Night cycles for the game which was superrr cool.

# Meeting with Nico 1 hours
Introduced Bridget (Associate Director) to Nico! It was pretty fun to see them interact, and just have Nico share his knowledge on Game Dev Production to Bridget. Really happy how it turned out.

# Directors Meeting: 4 hours
4 hours, for one of the meetings. There wasn't one the previous week, due to a concert we were having :), so that was just done async. However this directors meeting comprised of writing up documentation for a new minigame to be added into the main game, working on more UI, and also checking up on the Associate Directors tasks. The next 2 hours were comprised of me cleaning tasks and making sure everything in the Notion was up-to-date.

# Backing up Studio Stuff: 4 hours
Needed to back up Studio Atlassian machine. Remembered I had it. Took like 2 hours to try and get it onto the dropbox. The 2 more hours to just figure out how to get it properly synced. Took basically the whole night to copy everything over, but I'm only going to log the hours it took to actually figure out how to get everything working. Pro-tip, dropbox sucks for uploading large files.
