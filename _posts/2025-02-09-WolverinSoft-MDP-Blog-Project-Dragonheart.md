# Introduction - TOTAL TIME: 12+ hours
Hello!!! Welcome to blogpost 1. I'm kinda drowning, and glad that I took Studio for 2 credits this semester. So I'm not going to write as much, but I am doing a like much more LOL. So I'm sorry these might be shorter.

# GTM: 2 * 2 = 4 hours
For the last 2 weeks GTMs have been focused on getting work done and task assignments. We have had a focus on getting production. This semester is much more focused on getting the polish done on project Dragonheart. The quick demo of which can be found here: https://gavinmcg.itch.io/project-dragonheart

This week specifically we have been getting a focus on UI/UX since this game relies heavily on a lot of UI/UX. We are also implementing nifty little animations that add to the overall feel of the game. One thing I really liked that was added was little bird and fishies that fly across the map and make the game feel much more alive.

# Directors Meeting: 2 * 2 = 4
First Directors meeting was focused on onboarding Associate director with the current directors team. We also talked about just general. Bridget, my associate director also talked about possibly reviving Marketing and helping to build more awareness to WSOFT Studio as a brand. I thought it was a great idea, but just cautioned that it needed to start small. I don't want it to be an unfocused mess like the previous Studio was. So I want to encourage all members that ever accomplish any initiative to have a proper and measurable goal in mind, and that it should align with the Studio goals & mission.

# Worked on Studio Website: 3 hours
Refactored the Studio Notion website and added it your sites to the notion sites ;) You can check it out here: [WolverineSoft Studio Notion Site](https://wolverinesoftstudio.notion.site/)

# Reviewing documentation & writing documentation the future directors: 3 hours
Needed to write some documentation for future Studio director, and needed to re-review the current documentation, write comments, and ping the relevant people to update them in order to ensure that everything is up to date.
