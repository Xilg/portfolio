> What I'm listening to: March 9th - Remioromen

# Introduction - TOTAL TIME: 12+ hours
Hello!!! Welcome to my 5th blogpost this semester!

# Studio GTM: 4 hours
These past 2 weeks were about figuring out how to most efficiently allocate our time to finishing the game with the ~3 weeks that we have left. The first week was dedicated to looking and mapping out our progression which was also mapping out our work for the rest of the week. Then this second week, was straight up a work session.

# Meetings with Nico: 2 hours
Met with Nico twice over the past 2 weeks. Once was mapping out a timeline in order to see what our handoff timeline will look like with Bridget. Then the second one was having a discussion on summer cycle logistics. We just sent out a poll in order to gauge interest.


# Directors Meeting: 4 hours
The first directors meeting this week was dedicated to talking about the dungeon mini-game. Something that had been being developed for about a month now, but was kind of stagnant due to GDC. Also talked about just things that we need to get done. Asked Spears to map out the progression for the game so that we had a gameplan going forwards for the next 3 weeks. The second directors meeting was dedicated to finishing up work that had been assigned previously.

# Admin work: 2 hours
I wrote up documentation on how to best apply for GDC funding, so that if Bridget decides to go forwards with GDC next semester she won't be left dead in the water about how to go about starting it. Also did some notion cleaning, and also did some preparation for the 494 showcase.
