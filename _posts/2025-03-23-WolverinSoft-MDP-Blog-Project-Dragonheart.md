# Introduction - TOTAL TIME: 31 hours+
Hello!!! Welcome to my 4 blogpost this semester!

# Studio GTM: 4 hours
This weeks one and only Studio GTM was kind of hectic. Its coming back from break season, then also GDC is right around the corner. So we blitzed through task assignments to hit the 12pm time where we did our Portfolio / LinkedIn review for those in preperation for GDC. This review was done by Natalie Fang :3. I felt that the portfolio review went rather smoothly. I went first, after no one had raised their hand to go first and got absolutely blasted by Natalie (which was totally fair considering my Portfolio / LinkedIn has not been worked on very much) but it was chill cuz me and Natalie are cool with each other. The portfolio review ended up going a little overtime, but I was happy because more and more people kept raising their hands. Which made me incredibly happy to see my Studio Members taking initiative despite it being really scary to have your Portfolio reviewed and critiqued in front of your peers.

# Art Portfolio Review: 3 hours
Rachel did this one. She was late, because she forgot. But our artists were able to get good feedback prior to GDC so that was great!


# Directors Meeting: 2 hours
This Directors meeting was focused on GDC planning first. So that we had a checklist for things that we had finished up. Discussed Portfolio reviews, then had Bridget focus on playing the game to get her up to date with whats going on right now. Also disccused tilemaps.

# GDC Trip 8 + 8 + 6 = 22 hours spent at the Expo hall networking, at talks, & exploring
This is a quick overview of our days at GDC
- Tuesday: spent traveling all the way to GDC and making our way to airBNB
- Wednesday - 8 hours: all day at talks + expo hall. Netoworked and added a few people here. Many of us scheduled talks with individual people to talk with and gather advice
- Thursday - 8 hours: I had made more connections this day as I got more familiar with the expo hall. I got a bunch of free stuff too! Love going around expo halls and getting free stuff. Best connection I made was with a Studio researcher at xbox games. Really neat talking to her.
- Friday - 6 hours: today was less focused on getting to know people, more just seeing what I hadn't see. Also we had an Alumni dinner we had scheduled, which was only really with Nico and his friends and Ravi. However, it was really nice getting to see Nico in person, he is really different from what I had imagined. Just goes to show that online is so much worse than in-person :((. I had a blast meeting everybody :).
- Saturday: today was spent traveling back to Ann Arbor

Overall GDC was a big... BIG BEEG W. All the members that went were able to expand their network, get critiques on their portfolios and LinkedIn, and have a blast exploring SF. I will be uploading images and videos to the Notion website shortly.
