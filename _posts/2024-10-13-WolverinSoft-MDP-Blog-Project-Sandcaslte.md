# Introduction - TOTAL TIME: 24+ Hours
Hello! Welcome to the first MDP blogpost / journal. This year I am the Director of WolverineSoft Studio. We are currently heading 3 projects at once. This year we the Studio is split into 2 different projects. Production and R&D. Production is the main project, which is our Sandcastle RTS game. While R&D is dedicated to buliding the future games of the Studio. R&D currently has 2 teams + Production.

# Leads Meetings (5 Hours)
## First Leads Meeting (2 hours)
Our first leads meeting after kickoff was getting a gutcheck on how we were feeling on the current state of Project Sandcastle RTS & also looking through the polls to see who was interested in R&D and who was interested in Production. After some debate, we ended up splitting 7 people into 2 groups. One group with 4 and another with 3.

Another side project that we are looking into, which Kennedy & Ravi are helping out with is trying to get our own Gitlab instance up and running so that we can automate weekly builds. ITS has generously given us a separate computer & a 4tb SSD, and has been helping us to setup the Gitlab Instance. During the leads meeting we were also figuring out the next steps in which to setup the Gitlab, since this was our first time doing this kind of thing.
## Second Leads Meeting (3 hours)
This meeting was dedicated to work time. First bit of the meeting was dedicated to figuring out our Gitlab situation. Currently we are able to log in, but there are some errors that are popping up. We will be trying to squash those errors after Fall Break.

We also discussed how the Walls should be functioning. It was originally assigned to a designer, but it came up in conversation and ended up taking up a good chunk of the meeting time. Later added this to the thread in the Walls channel in the Discord.

We also talked about the current state of our Socials and Recruitment. **QUICK DISCLAMER**: This is not an excuse, just me stating how it is right now. Another thing that came up in conversation was the lack of applications compared to previous semesters. Which is pretty much my fault. We had 38 applicants this semester, compared to the 80+ that we had before. I wasn't sure how to properly lay out the recruitment timeline. At the same time, I had to allign it with the Clubs mass-meeting. Which pushed our kick-off back a bit... Point is, there were a lot of avenues of on-campus advertising that I had not known about... and still do not know about so I just did the best I could in advertising to see how many people we could gather this semester. 
Tried reaching out to stamps newsletter, but I wasn't sure if it was the right one: These 2 emails specifically: artdes-commons@umich.edu, artdes-studlife@umich.edu | both didn't give a reply. Also reached out to UMSI student life, which actually got us one of our current designers, which is nice! In the future I'll probably reach out to CoE and Ross to figure out something. Also, adding on to that, Me and the Assistant Treasurer were able to book a table at Ross meet the clubs! We sat there for the whole time on the second day... and I'm pretty sure no one who came up to our table actually signed up. At least the ones that I remembered I did not see them sign up for Studio.

Anyways, we put a temporary date for talking about recruitment dates for the future at Novemeber 27th. Need to start planning now anyways.

# Solidifying both R&D and Production (2 Hours)
Trying to figure out the logistics of R&D and how close I wanted to have it mimick the summer cycle was challenging. I wasn't sure if it was better to have it be more free-form or have it be more guided. Went back and forth between Nico, Cam, and Natalie to see what they thought. Ended up deciding on a mixture. Polling on Kick-off to see who is interested in what, then splititng them into different teams.

I will talk about how those teams are functioning in the GTMs section. But as of right now I am happy with how they are communicating with each other.

# Creating Slides (4 hours)
I have severly underestimated the time that it takes to make slides :). It took about 2 hours each time to make the slides. For kick-off & the meeting after that, onboarding was the most difficult. Coordinating with leads & current project members what the most imporant things to convey within the 2 hours timeframe that we had in the meetings was difficult.

Here are the slides:

# Studio GTMs (5 hours)
So I decided to change a little bit of the meeting structure this semester.

Jackbox or some sort of game at the beginning of the meeting. Then into meeting logistics. This is to attempt to help foster a sense of community within Studio and break the ice. Something that we thought was missing from previous semesters.

Then we move into annoucements, logistics, and try to minimize the meeting time to allow for more time actually working on the project and trying maximize communication during these times. That is the plan going forwards for the meetings and we'll see how it goes.


# GDC Planning (5 hours)
We're planning a GDC Trip! Had a meeting with Mariah first, which lasted about an hour, then had the planning meeting with the treasurer. Got told to give CoE a prelimnary plan. So we sent that to Mariah. Looking forwards to the feedback!

# Playtesting and Bug Catching (2 hours)
