> What I'm listening to: Color your night (P3 Reloaded)

# Introduction - TOTAL TIME: 32 Hours
Hello! Welcome to my third devblog! I am slowly losing my mind!!!!! Just kidding. I'm excited and nervous for the next few weeks coming up. 

# Directors 1 Meeting (3 hours)
This meeting was mainly dealing with again, GDC grants and filling them out, while also talking about the current state of the project. We worked through some of art things, and generated a list of suggestions / action items for the current game. 
"- Notes for Sandcastle:
    - Disable shadows
    - New skill tree
    - Fix art placement in world
    - Night time wave spawning
    - Trying to reuse art for enemies:
        - ranged ant (ranged unit)
        - big ant (tank)
    - Kennedy will be implmenting armors
    - Also ask for maintainer role.
    - Walls go more far apart probably
- Dec 1st worksession → sunday after thanksgiving, non-mandatory meeting.
    - pizza, alfredo sauce"
Rest of the time was work time, there will be more stuff trust me!!!

# Finishing slides + work session (5 hours)
Yay! I'm getting better at making slides. Or really, its just because these meetings are more heavily worksession based vs meeting and admin stuff based. Had to get the associate. However needed to create some more forms. Also, Created a form for playtesting (which unfortunately came too late... we were able to get some quick feedback, however at this point we simply do not have enough time to be playtesting this game, just need to get it out of the door).

# Created form for Associate Director position (2 hours)
Created a form for the Associate Director position. Took around 2 hours to figure out how to properly word everything I wanted. Unfortunately it looks like literally no one wants to be doing this position. HAHAHAHAHAHAH It makes sense though, no one applied to be a producer this semester. It kinda blows since I don't want to force anyone into this position + if someone gets forced into it they will either become miserable (e.g. the rumors i've heard of our 2nd Studio Director) or just not do it well because they don't care enough. Its terrifying and I hope I find someone ASAP.... although I highly doubt it. We'll see what happens.

# Studio 1 GTM (2 hours)
Same drill as before. Updates on the various R&D Projects, and updates on Project Sandcastle RTS. Which has a name now: Defenders of the Dune! Super excited. Lin also made some killer artwork. Announced the Associate Director role here, unfortunatley no one wants the position / hasn't signed up as of today... Decided to have no thanks giving break worksession!!! Will update on what happens with that below. Rest of the time was dedicated to worksession.

# Directors 2 Meeting + worksession (10 hours)
We had a directors meeting... that might have gone a little overkill. Ended up staying and highkey losing our minds just grinding out a lot of work. For me it was: Ensuring the logistics of the longer worksession the next day (pizza really), supervising UI design that Art Director was making, getting more art in during that time, next semester logistics, GDC (WE GOT MONEY FOR IT YAYY, we still need more though), and being more watchful over R&D groups. Had a lot of fun. I'm really tired right now. You'll see why. We watched Spongebob when we took a quick break though!!!! Yarger do you like Spongebob??? Most of the time was dedicated to overseeing the creation of the UI/UX and updating the Studio website too, we're moving it to Notion. Here's some notes that we took:

"- Preparing Winter Applications
    - ideally being able to review them over winter break
    - either 1-2 weeks, when applications can close. They get 2 weeks outside of classes. Then 2 weeks during.
    - Posters. Do same stuff.
    - Required to fill out the form again, then they don’t have to do design challenge.
- Add onto slides about GDC trip. We have gotten funding. Please lockin and tell us you are for sure
    - Ask people in CoE to get individual funding for GDC
- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oO956pchCyMOh6KfvltFuY5_EAgOntOu2Ez01Pfle8s/edit?usp=sharing - Meeting with Nico & Jordan discussion
- State of the Projects
    - Sandcastle is almost finished. Just needs some tweaking
    - 
- Next Semester
    - Central classroom for meetings → trying to make it as unobtrusive as possible
    - Having it be from 12-4. So we have more time for work sessions in person
    - 
- Changing notion / PM practices
    - Instead of marking it on notion, we create threads for tasks so we are able to update them realtime. This makes it so that communication and task management stays soley on Discord
    - Tasks will be marked done or whatnot VIA PMs & leads ONLY. No longer by people themselves
- Hammer down deadline for R&D Groups
    - Compile together from our grading lists from summer cycles. Best design documents from each area.
    - Programming, Audio, Art, and Design
    - Hilary: go through art design document guide and cut down on it significantly
        - Referencing Sandcastle RTS.
    - It should sell to us that the project can be finished next semester
        - That the game mechanics are solid enough foundation that we can remove or polish it up to make it a functioning full game.
- Hilary
    - Sand textures
    - Contribution reports for R&D.
- Athena
    - Reaching out to Chris
    - Talking to Thompson: PAT305
    - Jeremy Edwards: PAT200
- Kennedy
    - EECS 280, EECS 281
- Connor
    - UMSI"

# Spontaneous Worksession (5 hours)
hahahahAHAHAHAHAHA worked on the slides for R&D. After getting a lot of work done, more still needed to get done. So we hopped in a Discord call and refined the summer cycles Design Documents, created slides so that R&D would be clear on what they need to get done in the upcoming weeks, and worked until ~6am. Got those slides done, got some more UI work done, figured out more logistics, ordered that pizza. Lets go. 

Here is a picture of my vibe after the worksession:

# Studio 2 GTM (4 hours)
This Studio GTM was an extended one. It looks like a lot of people either got sick, or were unable to make it today. We have about half attendanace. Which is fine, but its kinda bad because of the amount of work that still needs to get done right now. THE PIZZA ORDER GOT FLUBBED, DOORDASH ISN'T GOOD. But, we did really bond with the smaller group, which is nice. We got a good chunk of work done. Figured out how to implement some of the rest of the game, solidified R&D deadlines, updated GDC stuff with the team, checked in with R&D.

Here are the presentations:
