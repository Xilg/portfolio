# Introduction - TOTAL TIME: 12+ hours
Hello!!! Welcome to my 6th and last blogpost this semestser!

# Studio GTM 1: 4 hours
Crunch time! Crunch crunch crunch crunch. All just getting assets in and making sure the game flows correctly.

# Studio GTM 2: 6 hours
Ummm... its crunch time :) Today was figuring out UI, reassigning tasks, cutting things out of the game, and getting it in to tiptop shape. Its just getting things done. I'm literally drowning. Yarger also, I'm bringing you Bluey yogurt tubes for the showcase :3 be prepared. EVERYONE IS SOOOO COOPERATIVE, I love how everyone is like "hey can you tell me how you're doing this? hey how are you doing this?" really makes me happy how comfortable people have gotten within Studio with each other :)). Gonna be a little sad when I have to leave. But oh well, they'll be in good hands after I leave.
