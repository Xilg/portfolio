> What I'm listening to: Bloody Stream - Coda

# Introduction - TOTAL TIME: 27 Hours

Here is the breakdown:

# Coming back from break worksession (4 hours)
WORKED ON IMPLEMENTING A LOT OF THINGS. WE GOT A LOT DONE HERE. It was mainly My design directors and Allie!!! Thank god they were there. We also got pizza :)))) thank you yogurt for the Pizza advice we saving all the money ordering costco pizza <3333

# Steam Page work + admin work (1 hour 40 mins)
Had to start working on the Steam Page. In the future we should just get this out of the way at the BEGINNING of the semester. Then we have everything ready immediately. Seeing the pitfalls of not having it ready now. It was a lot of work, and learning photoshop back in middleschool is actually coming in handy. I can't believe I would actually think those thoughts...

# Helping git stuff with Darrien (1 hour 30 mins)
Found out one of the Audio peeps didn't have access to the gitlab...? So had to hop on a call to teach them how to use it really quick, this was for getting footage for the trailer (which unfortunately won't be releasing for the showcase AHHHHH). Ended up talking about some future studio stuff also I was testing out my motorcycle helmet during this call while I was riding. Long story short: they could not hear me. But I listened in and answered questions later.

# Directors meeting + Random work session (11 hours)
So.... I didn't have all the directors stay this long. However, we did stay an extra hour to work on stuff. The worksession later was just me and art director doing admin work, UI/UX stuff, & reviewing the R&D documents.

# Sunday GTM worksession (8 hours 30 mins)
Todays work session was ALL ABOUT GETTING THAT GOSH DARN UI IN. I HATE UI I HATE UI I HATE UI I HATE UI I HATE UI I HATE UI. Sorry I don't hate UI I'm literally a UI/UX design major, its just been an incredibly annoying endeavor to get in. Lots of bugs, lots of iteration, lots of fighting Unity.
