# Introduction - TOTAL TIME: 24+ Hours
Hello! Welcome to my second devblog! for a quick vibe check, one of my directors said that they much prefer the vibe of this years cohort vs the past semesters that they have been apart of Studio. That makes me really happy to hear! The effort and planning that is going to ensuring that the Studio isn't too boring is working! I hope to continue the morale & work ethic that people have been having so far!

# Leads Meeting 1 (3 Hours)
Our first leads meeting this time was dedicated towards work time. With my Art Director we were planning out the rest of the Art assets that needed to be made, how the animations should look, and more talk about how the walls should be looking in the game. We also talked more about GDC planning, Gitlab automations, and about the current state / progress of the game.

# Leads Meeting 2 (3 Hours)
Our second leads meeting was dedicated towards work time aswell. My art director was finishing up assets, audio director and programming director were helping me with more with filling out GDC grants. 

We also had a very long converesation about the future of the Studio. One of the points that was brought up was that rarely do people want to step into the realm of management in video games, double rarely does someone come into ross thinking about developming video games. A lot of the directors want to get into roles that utilize their skillsets, less so roles that are geared towards management so far. Whcih is something I agree with. One of the things that has been said a few times by a few artists is that Studio isn't a great place to actually get experience doing Art to get hired as an Artist for video game companies. 

# Studio GTM 1 (3 hours)
This Studio GTM was a status checkup for people. We didn't have a lot of people show up today / didn't have people show up on time today. I think its just because its after fall break + after midterms. This is more supported by the fact that the next GTM we had better turnout. People are still getting their tasks done which is good, and making good progress! Some things were done and needed to get merged, but that'll happen in the following week. Sometimes I'm not sure when I'm asking someone too much, pushing too hard, or being too annoying. I'm wondering how to find the sweetspot between being on top of something and not getting to becoming someones mom in regards to getting their stuff done.

# Meeting with Jordan (2 hours)!!
Had a meeting with Jordan took some good notes, had some awesome insights. Here are the notes from that meeting:
[Jordan + Studio notes](<../pdf/Jordan + Wolverinesoft Notes 10-22-24.pdf>)


It was super insightful, honestly I wish that I had met him earlier to help plan for the next Studios cycle, as his views on making games has influenced how I believe that Studio should run. E.g, smaller... MUCH smaller games, and ones that we will be recreating in the future. Also just tips in general on what best to do to focus in on in terms of design scope.

# Studio GTM 2 (3 hours)
Todays Studi GTM: we played scribble, and did Studio pictures! After that we moved into projects work time. Work time right now is just mostly updates, making sure people are on task, and making Studio the time where work + communication happens. I much prefer this over the previous Studio meetings. For R&D one of the teams is doing pretty well, and the other team I'm not so sure about. I think its interesting to see the different work ethics of the different teams and seeing how they overcome stuff. We will be moving into playtesting when everbodies builds are finished by next week and seeing how that goes. Hopefully it'll be good fingers-crossed. The Studio meetings tend to go overtime for me at least since I'll stay behind to ask questions for some of the folks that stay after, especially R&D. I honestly wish I had an extra pair of hands with me right now to help with managing the Studio... I don't really know, so far looking at what people want to do, no one really wants to take up the Studio Director role... one of the things that we had discussed was to actually shorten down the workload of Studio director to something that wouldn't take up too much of the Studio Directors time, and would still give them enough time to do developement. Just getting hiring done is already so much work and requires so much effort.... Not sure how to proceed with the Directors position. They are sort of managerial, they don't get to practice their skills that much since they spend most of their time doing management stuff... my Art director has expressed the opinion that the Directors opinion feels like a sacrifice that someone has to make... which I agree to a certain point. Unfortunately someone has to do it... Like who will set the standards without the Directors? Its just like a weird power dynamic, I have a few things in my head but I'd rather draw them out vs write about it right now.

# GDC Meeting with Raphael, sales rep for booth (1 hour)
Had a meeting that my Audio Director had set us up with. I went into it thinking it was someone who would be helping us get tips and tricks & info for GDC. But most of the time we were there was dedicated to him trying to sell us a booth, which I don't blame him for it its his job, just that whenever we would try to ask for information regarding GDC it would always steer back to a booth, despite us making it clear that we don't have enough support, we are a club, we don't have a lot of money, just students.

# Creating Slides (2 hours)
More busy work on creaing slides for the Studio. They are linked here:

# Creating peer evals (3 hours)
Had help from Art director in making peer evals for the Studio. Just wanted to get a general vibe check. Took a little longer than expected though. I had a lot of trouble trying to optimize it. Really nice to have Directors double checking and helping out with it.



# GDC Planning (4 hours)
More filling out grants and making sure that we have the right information! Making sure that we have everything in place.

# Playtesting and Bug Catching (2 hours)
