# Introduction - TOTAL TIME: 24+ Hours
Hello! Welcome to my third devblog! This time of the semester seems like the busiest. Which kind of sucks since we need to 

# Directors 1 Meeting (3 hours)
This meeting was mainly with me and the programming director. We were still trying to figure out gitlab CI/CD logistics. We were also able to finish up the mirroring of the GitLab onto the UMICH EEECS gitlab. This is so that we have an extra backup incase the main machine that we are using fails! Me and the programming director also were talking about the state of the project aswell as the filling out more funding / grant requests for our upcoming plans for the GDC trip.

# Finishing slides + work session (4 hours)
FINISHING SLIDES ALWAYS TAKES A WHILE. I think I just tend to overthink a lot of these things. But I feel that it is just so important to ensure that all the information that you need is conveyed as well as it being as concise as possible on the slides itself. I don't know if its just me, but I just find it really difficult to ensure that the information is conveyed the right way. So I'll spend a few minutes just like staring at a sentence or bullet point thinking about how I'm going to explain it, and to make sure that it conveys the information that I am trying to get across aswell. After that I was working on making sure that our budget for GDC is good. We are waiting on the funding from COE and I really hope that it goes through, even a fraction of our total budget would go a long way in buying us ticket, flights, and housing. Unfortunately the deadline for the earlybird tickets are approaching and I don't think we will be able to hit that deadline. Makes me a little nervous. HOWEVER, he were able to secure 10 expo passes! Which makes me incredibly happy! That's so much value for us!

# Studio 1 GTM (2 hours)
This GTM was dedicated to project updates and addressing the mid-point peer evaluations feedback that we had gotten. A few people had said that they missed some of the old structure. So we took steps to implment a little bit more structure: 60 second updates for each person to going around the the group so everyone knows what everyone is doing. I love this!!!! We're getting feedback on our processes, making improvements to them, and asking for more feedback and seeing people content with the processes! The 2 R&D projects look to be going pretty well. They have good updates, and full gameplay loop, and are ready to start playtesting! I'm ready to see if they are able to really pull through with playtesting and iterate on their designs.

# Directors 2 Meeting (3 hours)
This directors meeting was dedicated to seeing the progress of everyones tasks. My art director had a few things that she needed to get done, so the majority of the time was spent getting those assets in. Me and the programming director continued working on getting that CI/CD stuff working. Its been a huge hassel going back and forth with ITS / DCO on our issues. I think they're lowkey getting sick of us.... :') but thats fine. Our sound effects are slowly getting in, and we will have to start implementing them soon. We also talked about reusing the ant asset for different enemies instead of creating new assets for them, I think this is a great idea presented by my Art Director. We also talked about cutscenes, splash-art, and UI. Which will also be coming in the coming weeks. I'm worried about the potential crunch that will be coming in the following weeks, but I think that is just something we will have to live with. Also got a quick read on who would be staying next semester. Looks like most of my team will be staying (yay!) but I still have to find my replacement. I'm happy that my team likes workign with me and that the team likes working with each other. Chokes me up a little seeing the difference between last year and this year.People are actually talking with eachother!!!

# 5 hour work session with Art Director (5 hours)
This was on Saturday 11/9 night... last night! Where I had gotten back from a 5 1/2 hour film shoot. So I spent the time finishing up the Studio slides, trying to get an Industry Talk with Rachel, and also trying to figure out the logistics on finding my succesor... AGHHHH thats a lot of thinking to do. I didn't help that my stomach was hurting the whole time!!!!! Yarger do you perchance have some pepto bismol? :). I also made a google form outlining the conditions for the Associate Director role, which will be dedicated to training up my sucessor. I hope that people will be applying for it. However I doubt that people are actually interested in the position. Fingers crossed.

# Studio 2 GTM (2 hours)
This Studio GTM was dedicated to getting a gutcheck from everyone. Looks like this week was particularly rough for people. I literally said last week that people should not be coming in late! AND THEN I LITERALLY COME IN LATE BECAUSE OF MY STUPID STOMACH. Anyways the Studio peeps kind clowned me for it. Was a nice moment. WE ARE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS THOUGH. LIKE THE BUILD STATE IS REALLY NICE RIGHT NOW. I WANT TO SHOW PEOPLE!!!!!!!

Here are the presentations:

# Meeting with Cam! (1.5 hours)
Talked through with Cam about the status of our project and where its at. I like that Cam is super encouraging about stuff. And its also nice to be able to relate to literally thinking about Studio 24/7 and answering questions about it during class. Had a cool moment about it! Otherwise Cam said that they would be down to do playtesting and that we should definitely schedule it with them soon! Otherwise the rest of it was really just updates on the situation.

# discussion about future logistics (3 hours)
Had a discussion about the future of Studio, future logistics, and how to decide my successor. Talked about how a lot of people just want to make games instead of actually managing the Studio. Talking about looking for my sucessor outside of studio, and also talking about leads structure for the future. How production will work. Especially with 2 different R&D teams going. Needs more discussion. I've been thinking that maybe we could get people involved in the hiring process. Give them the structure and outline and ensure that the quality of applicants are strict and the same.
